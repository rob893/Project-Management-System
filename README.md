# Project Management System
You can view the deployed application here: http://ksucsprojects.com/ProjectManagementSystem/index.php

What initially started out as a school project turned into a personal project of mine after I continued to develop it long after turning it in. I continued developing this project to hone my PHP, SQL, and Bootstrap skills.

This Project Management System allows a user to manage projects, employees, a project's requirements, risks, and hours worked (both total hours for the project and hour worked on each individual requirement as well as a breakdown of which activities those hours were spent on (such as coding, testing, management, etc.)). The system also allows an employee to log the amount of hours worked on each requirement that employee is assigned to.
