	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
	<p>Welcome to group 1's project for SWE6633 fall 2017. We purchased this webspace and domain name to deploy this project on. We used a standard LAMP stack to develop this system. 
		The primary language used to develop this system was PHP (which includes the use of HTML and CSS). SQL was used for database queries (with the database being MySQL). 
		Javascript and JQuery were also used for small client side scripts. We used the Bootstrap framework for design.</p>
	<p>This Project Management System allows a user to manage projects, employees, a project's requirements, risks, and hours worked (both total hours for the project and hour worked on 
		each individual requirement as well as a breakdown of which activities those hours were spent on (such as coding, testing, management, etc.)). 
		The system also allows an employee to log the amount of hours worked on each requirement that employee is assigned to.</p>
