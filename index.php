	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
	<p>Welcome to the Project Management System. A standard LAMP stack was used to develop this system. 
		The primary language used to develop this system was PHP (which includes the use of HTML and CSS). SQL was used for database queries (with the database being MySQL). 
		Javascript and JQuery were also used for small client side scripts. The Bootstrap framework was used for design. This project is mobile friendly.</p>
	<p>This Project Management System allows a user to manage projects, employees, a project's requirements, risks, and hours worked (both total hours for the project and hour worked on 
		each individual requirement as well as a breakdown of which activities those hours were spent on (such as coding, testing, management, etc.)). 
		The system also allows an employee to log the amount of hours worked on each requirement that employee is assigned to.</p>
